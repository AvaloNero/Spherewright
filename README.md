Spherewright is a structured, safety-first control bridge for **Dyson Sphere Program**. It lets an external MCP-capable Agent observe the live game and perform bounded actions through normal DSP systems—without embedding an LLM, editing saves, injecting items, or driving the UI with screenshots and keyboard/mouse macros.

The project is experimental and under active development. The original **M0 — First Red Matrix** milestone is complete; the current development save has also validated automatic power-engine, plastic, titanium-ingot, diamond, gear, electric-motor, water, organic-crystal, titanium-crystal, structure-matrix, particle-container, logistics-drone, and planetary-logistics-station production plus same-star interplanetary flight. The first planetary logistics station is normally built, powered, configured, and loaded with ten production-line drones; the same factory has now produced and normally saved a second station, which is ready for construction and a real local shipment before the same-star interstellar logistics gate.

Runtime evidence currently targets DSP `0.10.34.28529`, single-player peaceful mode, sandbox disabled, and 1× resources.

## What it provides

- An authenticated, current-user-only Named Pipe between the game Plugin and the local MCP server.
- Structured reads for the player, progression, recipes, build catalog, resources, factory entities—including detailed logistics-station state—power, the local star system, actions, and the per-save gameplay journal.
- Two-phase `prepare → commit` actions for movement, harvesting, handcrafting, research, construction, building configuration—including no-inventory-mutation logistics-station slot configuration—player/storage and conservation-checked station-fleet transfers, refuelling, saving, and recovery.
- Native-tick same-star flight with a separately saved, expiring pre-flight checkpoint that remains reusable only while that exact flight needs recovery, then loses its capability on success and retires after the covering primary save.
- Exact owned-world restart handoff: healthy planned restarts load only the ticket-bound primary save, while quarantine recovery alone may use a fresh fixed LastExit whose header already proves the minimum tick. Spherewright never exposes a save picker or enumerates unrelated saves.
- Per-save first-event journaling for manual output, production-line output, technology selection, and upgrade selection, including wall-clock/in-save time plus the durable-through sequence, pending-write flag, and persistence error.
- Readback, state hashes, short-lived plans, idempotency, single-flight execution, and write quarantine when a result cannot be proved.

Spherewright is a control layer, not an autonomous planner. The external Agent decides what to do; Spherewright supplies typed state, legal primitives, and evidence-backed results.

## Architecture

```

- `Spherewright.Contracts` contains the public DTOs and protocol contracts.
- `Spherewright.Bridge.Core` contains game-independent framing, safety, plan, fingerprint, and idempotency logic.
- `Spherewright.Plugin` is the thin adapter to the current DSP/Unity runtime.
- `Spherewright.Mcp` exposes the Bridge as MCP tools over stdio.

## Safety model

Writes are disabled by default. When enabled, every gameplay mutation is bound to a current owned session and follows a fresh read, a non-mutating prepare, one idempotent commit, and terminal/readback verification.

Spherewright deliberately does not use:

- sandbox mode, item injection, direct buffer writes, instant construction, technology injection, or game-speed changes;
- save editing, save enumeration, or loading an arbitrary save name;
- external memory scanning or modifications to `Assembly-CSharp.dll`;
- Computer Use, visual recognition, or keyboard/mouse macros for game operations.

All DSP and Unity access runs on Unity's main thread. Only deep-copied DTOs leave that thread. Ambiguous write outcomes quarantine further commits until the exact retained action can be proved or the same owned world is safely restarted from protected evidence.

See [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md), [docs/protocol.md](./docs/protocol.md), [docs/m0-status.md](./docs/m0-status.md), and [docs/experience-ledger.md](./docs/experience-ledger.md) for the approved 0.3–0.9 plan, protocol, live validation status, and accumulated operational evidence.

## Requirements

Release package users need:

- Windows
- Dyson Sphere Program (the currently validated build is `0.10.34.28529`)
- BepInEx 5 installed in DSP

The versioned Windows release package includes a self-contained MCP server; using it does not require the repository, source code, or a .NET SDK. See [release installation](./docs/release-installation.md).

Source builds additionally need:

- .NET 8 SDK
- PowerShell 7 recommended for the helper scripts

No game assemblies are committed to this repository. They remain local and are copied only into the ignored `.local/game-refs` build directory.

## Build and test

Core contracts, Bridge logic, and MCP tests do not require game assemblies:

```powershell
dotnet restore Spherewright.Core.slnf --locked-mode
dotnet build Spherewright.Core.slnf --no-restore
dotnet test Spherewright.Core.slnf --no-build
```

To build the BepInEx Plugin, first sync the minimal compile references from your local DSP/BepInEx installation, then build the full solution:

```powershell
./scripts/sync-game-refs.ps1
dotnet build Spherewright.sln --no-restore
```

If DSP is installed somewhere the locator cannot find automatically:

```powershell
./scripts/sync-game-refs.ps1 -DspDir 'D:\Games\Dyson Sphere Program'
```

The Plugin output is `src/Spherewright.Plugin/bin/Debug/net472/Spherewright.Plugin.dll` by default, or the corresponding `Release` directory when built with `--configuration Release`.

To produce the versioned Windows release zip, integrity manifest, and SHA-256 sidecar from a clean worktree:

```powershell
./scripts/package-release.ps1 -Version 0.3.0
```

The packager builds the full solution, publishes `Spherewright.Mcp.exe` self-contained for `win-x64`, verifies every staged file after zip extraction, and writes ignored artifacts under `artifacts/`. Creating an artifact does not create a tag or GitHub Release; those remain gated by [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md).

To repeat the package integrity and self-contained MCP `initialize`/`tools/list` smoke test independently:

```powershell
./scripts/test-release-package.ps1 -PackagePath ./artifacts/Spherewright-0.3.0-win-x64.zip
```

## Local setup

1. Copy `Spherewright.Plugin.dll` into a dedicated folder under DSP's `BepInEx/plugins` directory.
2. Launch DSP once so BepInEx creates `BepInEx/config/dev.spherewright.bridge.cfg`.
3. Keep `Safety.AllowWrites=false` for observation-only use. Set it to `true` only when you intend to authorize structured gameplay commits.
4. Start the MCP server from the repository:

   ```powershell
   dotnet run --project src/Spherewright.Mcp/Spherewright.Mcp.csproj
   ```

5. Register that stdio command with your MCP host.

Runtime descriptors and credentials are protected for the current Windows user and rotate when the Plugin starts. Do not copy them into logs, issues, or configuration files.

## Development status

The detailed, evidence-backed status lives in [docs/m0-status.md](./docs/m0-status.md). The current save's complete decision, research, upgrade, and first-output chronology lives in [docs/gameplay-timeline.md](./docs/gameplay-timeline.md). The short version:

- secure local Bridge and MCP surface: complete;
- ordinary peaceful 1× owned-world observation and action primitives: complete for the validated DSP build;
- first automatic red matrix: complete;
- automatic power engine, plastic, titanium ingot, diamond, gear, electric motor, water, organic crystal, titanium crystal, structure matrix, electromagnetic turbine, high-purity silicon, microcrystalline component, sulfuric acid, processor, graphene, thruster, particle container, logistics drone, and planetary logistics station production: complete;
- native same-star checkpointed flight: complete for the validated route;
- planetary/interstellar logistics and broader compatibility: in progress.

There are no stability or compatibility guarantees yet. Before reporting a bug, include the DSP version, BepInEx version, Spherewright commit, the structured error code, and sanitized action/state evidence—never auth tokens, plan tokens, raw save identities, or save files.

## Contributing

Issues and focused pull requests are welcome. Read [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) before changing gameplay behavior: it documents the main-thread boundary, ordinary-game constraints, proof requirements, and repository workflow. New DSP calls should be grounded in the exact current game assembly and recorded under `docs/research/`.
